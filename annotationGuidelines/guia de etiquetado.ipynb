    "Counts and measurements are an important part of scientific discourse.\n",
    "It is relatively easy to find measurements in text, but a bare\n",
    "measurement like 17 mg is not very informative. We want to know what\n",
    "thing is being measured, which property of it (e.g. length v. height),\n",
    "and any relations it may have to other measurements. However, relatively\n",
    "little attention has been given to parsing and extracting these\n",
    "important semantic relations. Obtaining that information is challenging\n",
    "because scientists' writing can be ambiguous and inconsistent, and the\n",
    "location of this information relative to the measurement can vary\n",
    "greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "MeasEval is a new entity and semantic relation extraction task focused\n",
    "on finding counts and measurements, attributes of these quantities (such\n",
    "as tolerances), and additional information including measured entities,\n",
    "properties, and measurement contexts. MeasEval is part of the 2021\n",
    "SemEval competition. More information on the MeasEval competition can be\n",
    "found on our [CodaLab\n",
    "page](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25770) and [Github\n",
    "repo](https://github.com/harperco/MeasEval).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are collecting annotations in preparation for this competition. These\n",
    "guidelines document our basic annotation set and provide rules,\n",
    "guidance, and examples for a number of the challenging or ambiguous\n",
    "scenarios you may encounter. The \"Basic Annotation Set\" and \"Annotation\n",
    "Steps\" sections of this document discusses the general annotation model\n",
    "and guidance for a two-phase annotation process. These are followed by\n",
    "sections detailing Special circumstances and providing examples.\n",

    "# Annotation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation process proceeds in 2 phases. Phase 1 is the simpler of\n",
    "the two, and involves marking all of the Quantities in a paragraph and\n",
    "recording additional information about each as described below. (The\n",
    "additional pieces of information are referred to as Quantity Modifiers).\n",
    "Phase 2 goes through the same paragraphs, but with only 1 Quantity\n",
    "pre-selected. The annotator then marks up the MeasuredEntity,\n",
    "MeasuredProperty, and Qualifier spans relevant to that Quantity as well\n",
    "as all applicable relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "This annotation exercise is broken down by paragraph. You will see one\n",
    "paragraph of text which should contain one or more Quantities. Those\n",
    "Quantities may have both a value and a unit (measurements), or only a\n",
    "value (counts). The values may be given with Arabic numerals (e.g. 12)\n",
    "or with words (e.g. twelve, one dozen). Some words may be phrases that\n",
    "do not contain numbers but are still quantities (e.g. room temperature,\n",
    "sea level, standard temperature and pressure, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to read the paragraph to understand any quantities\n",
    "within it. You should then annotate all Quantities in the paragraph. Be\n",
    "aware that not all quantities are measurement values. Counts of\n",
    "entities, such as \"**five** samples\", or \"**15** mice\", should also be\n",
    "annotated as Quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to include relevant text that indicates the application of a\n",
    "modifier, such as \"between\" \"less than\" \"approximately\", or symbols such\n",
    "as \"\\>\" or \"~\" ***if they are contiguous with the span***. Ignore them\n",
    "if they are separated by additional text, as we will return to them in\n",
    "Phase 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your finished document at the end of phase 1 should look like the\n",
    "following\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](v2example1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Quantity Modifiers, Units, and Additional Spans and Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase will contain a series of paragraphs, oftentimes duplicated,\n",
    "each with one Quantity (from phase 1) annotated. You may or may not be\n",
    "seeing paragraphs that you annotated previously.Â \n",
    "\n",
    "Read the paragraph and understand it well enough to do the labeling of\n",
    "the MeasuredEntities, MeasuredProperties, and Qualifiers according to\n",
    "the more detailed instructions and examples provided below. A Quantity's\n",
    "MeasuredEntity and any relevant MeasuredProperty or Qualifiers are\n",
    "collectively referred to as the context for the Quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, correct the Quantity if you notice any errors, then proceed with\n",
    "**Quantity Modifiers and Units** and **Additional Spans and Relations**\n",
    "according to the instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantity Modifiers and Units\n",
    "\n",
    "For each Quantity that you have annotated, follow the following steps,\n",
    "according to the instructions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Add any relevant Modifiers to the Quantity annotation.\n",
    "  - Add a \"Unit\" span for the relevant unit, if there is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Quantity is an approximate or uncertain value, include the text\n",
    "that indicates this in the span and tick the \"IsApproximate\" box. If the\n",
    "Quantity is a count, and does not have a corresponding unit, tick the\n",
    "\"IsCount\" Box. \"IsApproximate\" and \"IsCount\" are \"Quantity Modifiers\",\n",
    "which represent special conditions of a Quantity.Â \n",
    "\n",
    "If the Quantity represents one of the following special conditions, mark\n",
    "the text that indicates this and add the appropriate \"QuantityModifier\"\n",
    "from the dropdown. If text that indicates a modifier is adjacent to the\n",
    "Quantity, the span should include the modifier text. If the modifier\n",
    "text is not adjacent to the Quantity, but is adjacent to the\n",
    "MeasuredEntity or MeasuredProperty, include it there, otherwise, mark it\n",
    "as a Qualifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Table 2 provides examples for IsApproximate, IsCount, and the eight\n",
    "modifiers provided through the Dropdown. Example notation shows a\n",
    "relevant sentence, followed by relevant Quantity (Quant), MeasuredEntity\n",
    "(ME), MeasuredProperty (MP), and Qualifier (Qual) values. Note, these\n",
